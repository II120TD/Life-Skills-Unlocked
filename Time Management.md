### Understand the nature of time  

1. We all have 24 Hours a day! Unless you are living on Venus ( which has 2808 hour day!!),  you only have 24 hours. The fact of the matter is,  you can’t create more time. This can be empowering as all people have the same hours of the day as you.  
2. You can’t manage time, but you can manage yourself: you can only manage your focus 
3. Want to accomplish more: Energy and Focus are key to accomplishing everything in life.



### Understand the nature of goal and task setting 
When it comes to setting goals, breaking them down into actionable steps can often pose a challenge. As the saying goes, "Rome wasn't built in a day," and the same applies to our life goals, particularly in our careers. Effective goal setting is crucial for making the most of our time and progressing in life. Goals must be broken down into manageable steps to ensure success. It's important to write down your goals and review them daily to ensure that your tasks and learning activities align with your overarching objectives.

**Goals**: This term is everywhere in our daily lives. SMART goals, outlined at [MindTools](https://www.mindtools.com/a4wo118/smart-goals"), provide an excellent starting point. Goals can be categorized into long-term and short-term, with the overarching aim of transitioning into the field of technology. This overarching goal can then be further dissected into milestones (monthly achievements) and steps (weekly tasks), with tasks being set and completed daily.

**Milestones**: Often overlooked, milestones play a crucial role in the goal-setting process. They represent theme-based actions, such as mastering a new programming language. For example, learning Python/SQL, mastering AWS, or familiarizing oneself with front/back-end frameworks can serve as milestones in the journey towards transitioning into technology.

**Steps and Tasks**: This is where the real progress unfolds. Steps and tasks represent a series of actions that span over a week or a few weeks. Tasks should be designed to provide a sense of momentum – they should be long enough to witness progress yet short enough to be accomplished within a specified timeframe. It's within these steps and tasks that the magic of goal achievement truly happens.

**Understand the our Motivation/Energy :** 

Among the many factors contributing to waning motivation, two primary ones stand out:

1. Losing sight of our goals: When our objectives fade into the background, it's pivotal to realign ourselves with our core vision.
2. Drawing unfavourable comparisons: Whether likening our journey to scaling a mountain or climbing stairs, comparing our progress to lofty ideals can often lead to discouragement.

In terms of managing energy and mood:

Recognizing our human limitations, we acknowledge the need for regular breaks. Just a brief 10-minute respite can work wonders in replenishing our energy levels. Moreover, immersing ourselves in nature or taking a refreshing stroll outdoors can significantly uplift our spirits.

Conducting a mood audit becomes essential, particularly during challenging times like job loss or bereavement. It prompts us to evaluate our emotional well-being and tailor our daily plans accordingly. By asking ourselves how we're feeling each day and determining the feasible time commitment for our activities, we foster a healthier balance between productivity and self-care.

### Sunday is a fun day: find your End of week way.

Starting the week's rhythm typically commences on Sunday, though any day that aligns with your schedule works just as well. Engaging in this planning ritual establishes the groundwork for navigating the upcoming days smoothly.

**Time Blocking**: A Key to Efficiency

Time blocking, a strategy where you segment your day into dedicated periods for specific tasks, stands as a beacon of productivity. By minimizing multitasking, it sharpens focus and enhances overall efficiency. To dive deeper into this method, numerous resources, including digital calendars and informative articles, await exploration.

**Prioritization:** The Core of Effective Task Management

Prioritization, epitomized by techniques like the Eisenhower Matrix and the ABCDE Method, lies at the heart of task management. By meticulously assessing tasks, sorting them based on importance and urgency, and organizing them into a structured schedule, you pave the way for seamless progress
